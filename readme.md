# Experiments in Deep Reinforcement Learning

**Todo**

1. Set up variation with three files, one for the model, 
one to play a given model using a given checkpoint, and one for training models 
  - log actual results of testing, changing batch size, memory size, number of layers, time of training

2. Set up and Lstm example
